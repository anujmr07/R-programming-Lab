#### Execute the following cells to load the libraries

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

#### How likely is it to get three heads when tossing a fair coin 10 times?

### Sampling space and likelihood vector
```{r}
s = c('H','T')
p = c(0.5,0.5)
```


### Function to simulate one trial of the random experiment which in this case is tossing a fair coin 10 times
```{r}
simTrial = function(){
  tosses = sample(s,size=10,replace = T,prob=p)
  return(tosses)
}
```

### Replicate the trials of the random experiment a large number of times; in other words, we are simulating the random experiment a large number of times
```{r}
nsimulations = 10
simulatedData = replicate(nsimulations,simTrial())
```

### Function to check if event of interest (denoted as E) has occured which in this case is getting exactly 3 heads
```{r}
checkEvent = function(data){
  return((sum(data == 'H')==3))
}
```

### Calculate the fraction of times the event of interest E occured in the simulated data which is what we define as the approximate probability of the event E happening in the next trial of the random experiment
```{r}
mean(apply(simulatedData,2,checkEvent))
```
#### Suppose you are the head of a team that comprises 5 newly recruited software engineers. All 5 of them are equally skilled and are working on a major project under your guidance for which each one of them works on their respective code modules and merges it with the master project code. All modules have identical workloads. This merger happens on a weekly basis after which you compile the master project code. During a particular week's check, you find 5 compilation errors when compiling the master project code, with 4 of those errors tracing back to the module submitted by software engineer-1. The other software engineers thereafter call software engineer-1 clumsy. However, software engineer-1 claims that it was just bad luck and that any of them could have had their modules resulting in 4 out of the 5 compilation errors that you saw. As the team lead, the challenge for you here is to see if software engineer-1 has some valid statistical support for their position. To that end, you, as the team lead, first hypothesize that software engineer-1 is not clumsy. This means, you assume that any of the 5 software engineers' modules is equally likely to result in a compilation error. Under this hypothesis, using simulation calculate the probability that accused software engineer-1 submits a module that leads to at least 4 of the 5 compilation errors when compiling the master project code. Using the resulting probability, settle the claim as to whether software engineer-1 is clumsy as their colleagues are accusing or is actually not.

### Sampling space and probability vector
```{r}
s =  paste0('s',c(1,2,3,4,5))
p = c(0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2)
```
```{r}
# print(sample(s,size=1,replace = T,prob = p))
```

### Function to simulate the one trial of the random experiment
```{r}

simTrial = function(){
  sample(s,size=5,replace = T,prob = p)
}
```

### Function to check if software engineer-1's module has resulted in at least 4 out of the 5 compilation errors
```{r}
checkEvent = function(data){
  return(sum(grepl('s1',data))>=4)
}
```

### Simulate the trials of the random experiment a large number of time and calculate the probability that software engineer-1's module caused at least 4 out of the 5 compilation errors
```{r}
nsimulations = 1e4
simulatedData = replicate(nsimulations,simTrial())
```

```{r}
#here we are check the s1 claim where hes telling the 4/5 case errors from him is by chance , it can be caused by anyone , This shows that , his claim was wrong where hes telling that by chance he got 4 errors and anyone could get it, Thus telling his Hypothesis was wrong because the likelihood is soo little, that it is very rare to get that chance for him like 0.0078 i.e, 0.78%
mean(apply(simulatedData,2,checkEvent))
```


#### Suppose we have 30 students in a class. There are 365 different days in a year thar are possible for a student's birthday. What is the probability that at least two students in the class have the same birthday?

### Sampling space and probability vector
```{r}
s = c(1:365)
p = replicate(365,1/365)
```

### Function to simulate the one trial of the random experiment
```{r}
simTrial = function(){
  sample(s,size=30,replace=T,prob = p)
}
```

### Function to check if the event of interest--two students sharing their birthday--has occured
```{r}
checkEvent = function(data){
  return(length(unique(data))==30)
}
```

### Simulate the trials of the random experiment a large number of time and calculate the probability that at least 2 students share their birthday
```{r}
nsimulations = 1000
simulatedData = replicate(nsimulations,simTrial())
```

```{r}
1-mean(apply(simulatedData,2,checkEvent))
```
### We could also do this using pen and paper way , the above is the simulated way a
```{r}
P = 1
for (j in c(2:30)){
  P = P * (365 - (j-1))/365
}
1-P
```
#### Mr. Brown needs to take 1 tablet of type A and 1 tablet of type B together on a regular basis. One tablet of type A corresponds to a 1 mg dosage, and so does 1 tablet of type B. He keeps these two types of tablets in two separately labeled bottles as they cannot be differentiated easily. One day, on a buisness trip, Mr. Brown brought 10 tablets of type A and 10 tablets of type B. Unfortunately, he drops the bottles and breaks them. He does not have the time to go to a pharmacy to buy a new set of tablets but he needs to take his required dosage of both tablets A and B. The safe dosage that he needs for
both tablets A and B is given by 0.9 mg ≤ safe dosage ≤ 1.1 mg. Taking either an excess or a shortage of the required intake will result in serious health
issues.

- Suppose that after investigating the broken bottles, Mr. Brown finds 2 tablets that are still intact in the bottle for tablet A. The other 18 tablets are found to be mixed in a pile. Is it better for him to take one known tablet from the bottle and one from the pile, or take two tablets from the pile? Answer this by calculating the respective probabilities that he will not have any serious health issues for both options.
- Suppose that after investigating the broken bottles, Mr. Brown finds that the tablets are all mixed up. What is the probability that he will not have any serious health issues if he randomly picks 2 tablets?
```{r}
# sampling space for the partially broken bottle
s1 = c('A1','A2')

# Picking likelihoods for this sampling space
p1 = c(0.5,0.5)

#sampling space for the mixed up pile
s2 = c(paste0('A',c(3:10)),paste0('B',c(1:10)))

#picking likelihood for the mixed-up pile
p2 = replicate(18,1/18)

```
```{r}
# user-defined function to simulate one trial of the random experiment : Mr Brown picking one tablet from the partially broken and another tablet from the pile

#simTrial = function(){
#  return(c(sample(s1, size = 1, replace = T, prob = p1),sample(s2, size = 1, replace = T, prob = p2)))
#}

#For 2nd probability
simTrial = function(){
  return(c(sample(s2, size = 2, replace = T, prob = p2)))
}
```
```{r}
#Simulate the trials of the random experiment a large no of times

nsimulation = 1000
simulatedData = replicate(nsimulation,simTrial())
```
```{r}
#user-defined function to check 
checkEvent = function(data){
  return(sum(grepl('A',data))==1)
}
```

```{r}
# Calculate the fraction of times the event of interest occurred in the simulated data

mean(apply(simulatedData,2, checkEvent))
```
